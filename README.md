# Admin Dashboard Project

### Admin Dashboard | The Odin Project | Intermediate HTML and CSS

This is the final project within the "Intermediate HTML and CSS" course of "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to both practice the grid layout and the rest of the concepts that were introduced during the course.

You can view the original design given [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png).

It should be mention that the design implemented isn't one-to-one, there are several nuances.

**Skills demonstrated: CSS Grid, implementing a dashboard from a given design, basic light/dark mode**

**Webpage responsiveness: THIS PROJECT WILL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY ON MOBILE DEVICES**
