# Admin Dashboard Project

### Admin Dashboard | The Odin Project | Intermediate HTML and CSS

This is the final project within the "Intermediate HTML and CSS" course of "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to both practice the grid layout and the rest of the concepts that were introduced during the course.

You can view the original design given [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png).

It should be mention that the design implemented isn't one-to-one, there are several nuances.

*JavaScript was only used to switch between dark and light mode*

**Skills demonstrated: Intermediate HTML, Intermediate CSS, basic JavaScript**
